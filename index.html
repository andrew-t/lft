			Out of <span data-tag="population"></span> people,
			<span data-tag="infected"></span> (<span data-tag="prevalence"></span>%) have covid.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of the <span data-tag="infected"></span> infected people,
			<span data-tag="trueLftPositives"></span> test positive
			and <strong><span data-tag="falseLftNegatives"></span> people with covid tested negative and didn't isolate</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of the <span data-tag="uninfected"></span> healthy people,
			<span data-tag="falseLftPositives"></span> test positive
			and <span data-tag="trueLftNegatives"></span> test negative.
		</p>
		<p>
			That means <span data-tag="totalLftNegatives"></span> people test negative altogether,
			of whom <span data-tag="falseLftNegatives"></span> (<span data-tag="xLftNpp"></span>%) have covid. <strong>If you get a negative LFT, you have a <span data-tag="xLftNpp"></span>% chance of having covid</strong>, compared to a <span data-tag="prevalence"></span>% chance before you took the test. (And this is assuming you have no other reason to think you might have it&nbsp;&mdash; if you have symptoms then get a PCR.)
		</p> 
		<p>
			The <span data-tag="totalLftNegatives"></span> who tested negative don't get PCR tests so we can forget about them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Meanwhile, of the <span data-tag="totalLftPositives"></span> people who tested positive, <span data-tag="trueLftPositives"></span> (<span data-tag="lftPpp"></span>%) have covid. <strong>If you get a positive LFT, you have a <span data-tag="lftPpp"></span>% chance of having covid.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			The <span data-tag="totalLftPositives"></span> people with positive LFTs get PCR tests.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of the <span data-tag="trueLftPositives"></span> infected people,
			<span data-tag="truePcrPositives"></span> test positive
			and <span data-tag="falsePcrNegatives"></span> test negative. <strong><span data-tag="falsePcrNegatives"></span> people with covid get a positive LFT test, but don't isolate because they wrongly got a negative PCR confirmation test.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Of the <span data-tag="falseLftPositives"></span> healthy people,
			<span data-tag="falsePcrPositives"></span> test positive
			and <span data-tag="truePcrNegatives"></span> test negative.
		</p>
		<p>
			That means <span data-tag="totalPcrPositives"></span> people test positive on both LFT and PCR,
			of whom <span data-tag="truePcrPositives"></span> (<span data-tag="pcrPpp"></span>%) have covid, while <span data-tag="totalPcrNegatives"></span> test positive on LFT then negative on PCR,
			of whom <span data-tag="falsePcrNegatives"></span> (<span data-tag="xPcrNpp"></span>%) have covid. <strong>If you get a negative PCR after a positive LFT, you have a <span data-tag="xPcrNpp"></span>% chance of still having covid.</strong>
